* Features

  * Migrate entire library to :pypi:`anyio`, adding structured concurrency and :pypi:`trio` support.
  * Pipelines auto-execute when exiting their context manager; results are accessible in a type-safe way.
  * ``Library.wraps`` renamed to :func:`coredis.commands.function.wraps` and now supports callbacks.
  * :class:`~coredis.commands.Script` and :class:`~coredis.commands.Function` can now be called with
    optional callbacks to transform the raw response from redis before returning it. This is supported
    by their associated ``wraps`` decorators as well.
  * :meth:`coredis.Redis.lock` & :meth:`coredis.RedisCluster.lock` added as a convenient accessors
    for the Lua-based lock: :class:`coredis.lock.Lock` (Previously found in ``coredis.recipes.LuaLock``).

* Breaking Changes

  * Almost all classes (clients, connection pools, PubSub, pipelines) now require being used with
    their async context managers for initialization/cleanup.
  * Users should replace ``TrackingCache`` with :class:`coredis.cache.LRUCache` when providing a cache
    instance to the clients. Cache size can no longer be bound by byte size and only ``max_keys`` is supported.
  * All connection pools are now blocking.
  * Pipelines no longer expose an explicit ``execute()`` method and instead auto-execute when leaving
    their context manager.
  * When defining type stubs for FFI for Lua scripts or library functions, keys can only be distinguished
    from arguments by annotating them with :class:`coredis.typing.KeyT`.
  * Drop support for explicit management of ``watch``, ``unwatch``, ``multi`` in pipelines. This
    is replaced by the :meth:`coredis.pipeline.Pipeline.watch` async context manager.

* Removals

  * Drop support for ``RESP2``.
  * Remove ``Monitor`` wrapper.
  * Remove ``RedisGraph`` module support.
